# E-commerce-Back-End / Module 13


## Description

This application serves as the backend of a social media website, providing API endpoints & routes to grab data related to users, their friends, their thoughts (posts), and reactions to those posts
<br>
<br>

## Usage

To use the application, download the code from the repo found at https://github.com/obelisk477/social-network-api. Install the requisie packages & dependencies by using 'npm i' in your terminal. You'll need to have MongoDB installed locally in order for this to work.

After that you can start the server by running 'node index'. At this point, you are ready to make API calls to the server via an API testing tool -- though this can also function as a standalone API when connected to the frontend of a website. There won't be any initial seed data, but it should function as expected as you get, add, update, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions
<br>
<br>

###  Request Endpoints

Getting a list of all users or thoughts can be accomplished by sending a GET request to the API endpoints below:

- Thoughts: [/api/thoughts](/api/thoughts)
- Users:      [/api/users](/api/users)

POSTing to those endpoints will add thoughts and users to the database, respectively.

Adding a 'userId' or a 'thoughtId' to the end of either of those endpoints will allow you to update and delete users by making PUT and DELETE requests.

Reactions can be added or removed by sending reaction data in a POST (or DELETE) request to:

- [/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions](/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions)

Similarly, friends can be added or removed to friends lists by sending friend data in a POST or DELETE request to:

- [/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions](/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions)

###  Request Body

The following JSON serves as examples for the schema & fields of the aforementioned models. These can be modified as needed to POST and PUT data into the database

User
```
{
    "username": "obelisk477",
    "email": "lernantino@gmail.com",
}
```

Thought

    "username": "obelisk477",
